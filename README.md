#About
The Overwatch Team Generator started as a personal fun project for my friend Jade and I. We often held overwatch tournaments but didn't necessarily have the right tool for the job. With this site, you're able to configure an overwatch team with role parameters, take into account player's rankings for team balancing, and visit a history of your team creations in case you have a team in mind that you really like. You can add or remove players from the list, and you can set as many teams as you like.
